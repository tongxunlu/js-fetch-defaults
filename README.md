FetchDefaults.js
================
[![NPM version][npm-badge]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-defaults)
[![Build status][travis-badge]](https://travis-ci.org/moll/js-fetch-defaults)

给Fetch添加default options(全局设置，比如设置前置token)
=======================================================

FetchDefaults.js is a mixin for the [Fetch API][fetch] for browsers and Node.js that allows you to set a base URL (to then make relative requests) and default options (such as headers) for `fetch` calls. It's functional and immutable, in that it doesn't modify any objects given to it.

Installing
----------
```sh
npm install fetch-defaults
```

FetchDefaults.js follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org), so feel free to depend on its major version with something like `>= 1.0.0 < 2` (a.k.a `^1.0.0`).


Using
-----
Pass the native `fetch` function and a base URL and/or options to `fetchDefaults`:

```javascript
var fetchDefaults = require("fetch-defaults")

var apiFetch = fetchDefaults(fetch, "https://example.com", {
  headers: {Authorization: "Bearer 42"}
})
```

Then use the returned function as you would before:

```javascript
var res = apiFetch("/models", {method: "POST", body: "John"})
```

The above will then call the original function with a URL of `https://example.com/models` and a new merged options object. Options are merged recursively, so even nested objects, like headers, will work. The object you pass in will not be modified, just in case you were worried.

If you don't need to set any options, omit the second argument:

```javascript
var apiFetch = fetchDefaults(fetch, "https://example.com")
var res = apiFetch("/models", {method: "POST", body: "John"})
```

Likewise, if you don't need a base URL, pass only options:

```javascript
var apiFetch = fetchDefaults(fetch, {
  headers: {Authorization: "Bearer 42"}
})

var res = apiFetch("https://example.com/models", {
  method: "POST", body: "John"
})
```

### Browser
Browsers have the Fetch API available at `window.fetch`:

```javascript
var fetchDefaults = require("fetch-defaults")
var apiFetch = fetchDefaults(fetch, "https://example.com")
```

### Node.js
Node.js doesn't have a built-in implementation of the Fetch API, but you can use any library with a compatible interface, such as my [Fetch/Off.js][fetch-off] or [node-fetch][node-fetch]:

[fetch-off]: https://github.com/moll/node-fetch-off
[node-fetch]: https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch

```javascript
var fetch = require("fetch-off")
var fetchDefaults = require("fetch-defaults")
var apiFetch = fetchDefaults(fetch, "https://example.com")
```
